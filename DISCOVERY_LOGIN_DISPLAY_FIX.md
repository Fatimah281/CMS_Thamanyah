# Discovery Login Display Fix

## Issue Summary

The Discovery app had several authentication and display issues:

1. **Wrong Login Flow**: When users clicked "Sign In", they were redirected to the CMS app instead of handling authentication within Discovery
2. **Missing Username Display**: When users were logged in, their username was not displayed in the header
3. **Login Button Still Visible**: The login button remained visible even when users were authenticated
4. **Admin Redirect Logic**: Users were being redirected to CMS if they had admin roles, which was incorrect for Discovery users

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue was that the Discovery app was using the shared `AuthService` which was designed for CMS authentication (using username/password with backend API), but the Discovery app was configured to use Firebase authentication. This mismatch caused:

- Incorrect login flow (redirecting to CMS)
- Authentication state not being properly managed
- User display information not being shown correctly

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Discovery-Specific Authentication Service

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/services/discovery-auth.service.ts`

- **Firebase Integration**: Uses Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In
- **User Model Mapping**: Converts Firebase user to our User model
- **Observable State Management**: Properly manages user state with RxJS observables
- **No Admin Redirects**: Discovery users stay in Discovery (no admin redirects)

### 2. Updated Home Component

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced shared `AuthService` with `DiscoveryAuthService`
- Removed admin redirect logic (users stay in Discovery)
- Removed CMS authentication parameter checking
- Updated `signInWithGoogle()` method to use Firebase authentication
- Added `goToLogin()` method for proper navigation
- Removed test/debug methods

### 3. Updated Home Component Template

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.html`

**Changes Made**:
- Removed debug information section
- Removed "Go to CMS" button from user menu
- Updated login button to navigate to dedicated login page
- Ensured proper conditional display of user info vs login button

### 4. Created Dedicated Login Component

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/login/login.ts`

**Features**:
- Clean, modern login interface
- Firebase Google Sign-In integration
- Loading states and error handling
- Automatic redirect to home after successful login
- Responsive design with Material Design

### 5. Updated Routing

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/app.routes.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Added `/login` route for the new login component
- Maintained existing routes for home and program details

### 6. Created Authentication Guard

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts`

**Purpose**:
- Protects routes that require authentication
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
- Can be used for future protected features

### 7. Updated Test Files

**File**: `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.spec.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated to use `DiscoveryAuthService` instead of shared `AuthService`
- Maintained existing test coverage for authentication display logic

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Proper Authentication Flow
- Users can sign in directly in Discovery using Google authentication
- No more redirects to CMS for authentication
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### ✅ Correct User Display
- **When logged in**: Username is displayed in the header with user menu
- **When not logged in**: Login button is shown, no user info displayed
- **User menu**: Shows user name, email, and sign out option

### ✅ Improved User Experience
- Dedicated login page with modern design
- Loading states during authentication
- Success/error messages
- Automatic navigation after login

### ✅ Proper State Management
- Firebase authentication state is properly managed
- User information is correctly displayed
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firebase Configuration
The Discovery app uses Firebase authentication as configured in:
- `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/app.config.ts`
- `frontend/projects/discovery/src/environments/environment.ts`

### User Model Compatibility
The `DiscoveryAuthService` maps Firebase user data to our existing User model:
```typescript
const user: User = {
  uid: firebaseUser.uid,
  email: firebaseUser.email || '',
  displayName: firebaseUser.displayName || firebaseUser.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User',
  emailVerified: firebaseUser.emailVerified,
  photoURL: firebaseUser.photoURL || undefined,
  role: 'user' // Default role for discovery users
};
```

### Observable Pattern
The service uses RxJS observables for reactive state management:
- `user$` observable automatically updates when authentication state changes
- Components subscribe to user state changes
- UI updates automatically when user logs in/out

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Unauthenticated State**:
   - Visit Discovery app
   - Verify login button is visible
   - Verify no user information is displayed

2. **Login Process**:
   - Click "Sign In" button
   - Should navigate to login page
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Complete Google authentication
   - Should redirect back to home page

3. **Authenticated State**:
   - Verify username is displayed in header
   - Verify login button is hidden
   - Click user avatar to open menu
   - Verify user information in menu
   - Test sign out functionality

4. **State Persistence**:
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify user remains logged in
   - Verify user information is still displayed

### Expected Behavior

- **Before Fix**: Users redirected to CMS, login button always visible, no username display
- **After Fix**: Users stay in Discovery, proper login flow, username displayed when authenticated, login button hidden when authenticated

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/services/discovery-auth.service.ts` (NEW)
2. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.ts`
3. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.html`
4. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/login/login.ts` (NEW)
5. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/app.routes.ts`
6. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts` (NEW)
7. `frontend/projects/discovery/src/app/components/home/home.spec.ts`

## Conclusion

The Discovery login display issue has been completely resolved. The app now:

- ✅ Handles authentication properly within Discovery
- ✅ Displays username when user is logged in
- ✅ Hides login button when user is authenticated
- ✅ Shows login button when user is not authenticated
- ✅ Provides a smooth, modern authentication experience
- ✅ Maintains proper state management
- ✅ Follows Angular best practices

Users can now sign in directly in the Discovery app using Google authentication, and their information will be properly displayed in the header without any redirects to the CMS.
